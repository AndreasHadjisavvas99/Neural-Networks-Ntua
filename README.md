# Neural Networks and Intelligent Computing Systems

Welcome to the course repository for **Neural Networks and Intelligent Computing Systems**, part of the **Undergraduate Program (9th semester)** at the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering**, National Technical University of Athens.

## Course Overview

This repository contains code, resources, and projects related to the course **Neural Networks and Intelligent Computing Systems**. The course covers fundamental and advanced concepts in **Neural Networks**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Deep Learning**, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and hands-on implementations.

This project involved the application of various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including:

- **Supervised Learning:** Implemented Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and cross-validation for classification tasks. Worked with parametric and non-parametric classifiers, addressing bias-variance trade-off and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applied clustering techniques like k-means, fuzzy c-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to uncover patterns in data. Evaluated clustering performance using relevant metrics.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Developed models using Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning for decision-making processes.
- **Deep Learning:** Built neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on convolutional networks (CNNs), recurrent networks (RNNs), and residual networks for complex data representations.
